## About

I have over 10 years of experience as a full-stack engineer. In my current company, I am responsible for developing the internal localization system, handling a wide range of tasks including the development of translation services, developing translation systems using Azure OpenAI Service, and supporting localization across various teams.

In working with multiple teams within the company, I excel at identifying and solving issues that other members encounter. I actively incorporate new technologies, conducting technical verification in a short period and implementing them in our operations if there are no issues.

I have experience in the entire development process, from requirement definition to operation. I primarily use TypeScript and develop server-side applications and CLI tools centered around Node.js and Bun. For the backend, I frequently use the NestJS framework, and for the frontend, I develop using Angular and React. I leverage cloud technologies such as GCP, Docker, and Terraform for infrastructure.

While I have experience with Kubernetes, I prefer working in serverless environments (e.g. Cloud Run) that minimize the need for infrastructure management and maintenance.

In my personal activities, I develop libraries for the NestJS framework and create Unity editor extensions. I also have experience in writing technical books.
